Ported by Bigmoon Studios using Unity engine, the game will now let you free Arulco on OSX and Ubuntu just as well as on Windows. The best thing about it: Everyone that already owns Jagged Alliance: Back in Action on Windows will automatically get access to the two new versions as well. Just log in to your Steam account on your MAC or Linux system, download the game and start playing! New customers will also automatically get all three versions. \r<br>\r<br>IMPORTANT: Please note that we cannot ensure that any of the DLCs work with the MAC and LINUX versions. Also, cross-platform saving and loading is unfortunately not possible. The language of the MAC and Linux version can be set ingame via the options menu, not via the game properties in the steam client. \r<br>\r<br>Have lots of fun on Arulco!<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>Jagged Alliance Back in Action is a contemporary remake of the latest title in the much-loved Jagged Alliance series of turn-based mercenary-themed strategy games.\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\r<br>Designed from the ground up to offer a modern gaming experience, Back in Action showcases an updated isometric 3D look and interface, highly detailed character models and a variety of new gameplay features.\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tBack in Action takes players to the fictitious country of Arulco, where a ruthless dictator has seized power and only a small group of rebels stand to resist her.
