{"237870":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Planet Explorers","steam_appid":237870,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"In Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System. During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Modes<\/strong><\/h2>\r\r<br>Planet Explorers will feature single and multiplayer modes. \r<br>\r<br>In single player there are 3 distinct selections \r<br>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story Mode<\/strong> \u2013 Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, colony building, farming, ranching, training, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 100 types of potential enemies. Even though we\u2019ve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers, in reality, players can choose to not fight so much as to just plant a farm, make some food, keep the colonists alive, negotiate with the sentient aliens, and defend the perimeter from the local life forms. That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending. \r<br>\r<br><\/li><li><strong>Adventure Mode<\/strong> \u2013 This mode is based on a procedural map generated from a seed. Currently, it comes in a 40X40 kilometer map. Players will be able to complete random missions, defeat bosses, and explore different landscapes in the mode and eventually be able to setup conditions that they want to play (such as tower defense or attack an alien camp). This mode will also feature survival gameplay. The randomization in this mode will eventually pull in player made objects and locations so that a world will always feature something new and unique.\r<br>\r<br><\/li><li><strong>Build Mode<\/strong> \u2013 In this mode, there are no enemies and an infinite amount of building material. It also currently comes in a 40X40km map. Players will be able to build whatever they want in this mode, including everything in the Creations Editor. Think of this as the perfect testing ground to test everything you build. Or\u2026it\u2019s your place to build your garden without ever worrying about the pesky aliens.<\/li><\/ul>\r\r<br>Multiplayer allows Local Area Network and player hosted servers. It features several modes but some are still on the drawing board or going through technical trials so the final result is still in flux. Players playing multiplayer should be able to bring at least one of their created objects into multiplayer games, be it a sword, gun, or vehicle. \r<br>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Coop<\/strong> \u2013 Coop comes in many selections, such as adventure mode, tower defense mode, build mode, etc. This is pretty much an open world sandbox with a max of 32 players (this number still needs to be stress tested).\r<br>\r<br><\/li><li><strong>Versus<\/strong> \u2013 This mode allows teams of up to 16 players to battle against 16 players from another team. We allow full terrain manipulation in this mode. Currently, it's a point based system where one team wins if they reach a certain point level based on kills, built objects, resources mined, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\r\r<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features<\/h2><\/strong>\r<br><strong>Current<\/strong>\r<br>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>20+ hours of storyline\r<br><\/li><li>70+ types of enemies\r<br><\/li><li>20+ unique mainline NPCs\r<br><\/li><li>Able to dig\r<br><\/li><li>Able to build\r<br><\/li><li>Able to plant farm\r<br><\/li><li>Able to build colony\r<br><\/li><li>Able to have followers\r<br><\/li><li>Creation Editor to create vehicles, weapons, objects, vtols, and more\r<br><\/li><li>Day\/night cycle with realistic moon cycles\r<br><\/li><li>Weather system\r<br><\/li><li>15+ types of mineral types\r<br><\/li><li>200+ unique items\r<br><\/li><li>Resource scanner\r<br><\/li><li>Realtime AI pathfinding\r<br><\/li><li>Multiplayer COOP\r<br><\/li><li>Multiplayer VS\r<br><\/li><li>Realtime water physics<\/li><\/ul>\r\r<br><strong>Planned<\/strong>\r<br>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finish up the single player storyline\r<br><\/li><li>30+ more enemy types\r<br><\/li><li>More mainline NPCs\r<br><\/li><li>Multiple boss types\r<br><\/li><li>Story Editor\r<br><\/li><li>Pet system\r<br><\/li><li>Herding\r<br><\/li><li>Fishing\r<br><\/li><li>AI bot followers\r<br><\/li><li>Ingame music player\r<br><\/li><li>Hardcore survival mode\r<br><\/li><li>Negotiation with aliens\r<br><\/li><li>War with aliens\r<br><\/li><li>Missions to the moons\r<br><\/li><li>More objects in Creation Editor (boats, mechs, armor, etc.)<\/li><\/ul>\r\r<br><strong>Maybe<\/strong>\r<br>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Riding animals\r<br><\/li><li>NPC Marrying\r<br><\/li><li>NPC Procreation\r<br><\/li><li>Season system<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"In Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System.
