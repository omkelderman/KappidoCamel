Players build space ships and space stations of various sizes and utilization (civil and military), pilot ships and perform asteroid mining.\r<br>\r<br>Space Engineers utilizes a realistic volumetric-based physics engine: all objects can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game comes with two game modes: creative and survival.\r<br>\r<br>Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.\r<br>\r<br>Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.\r<br>\r<br>Space Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as a tactical shooter as well.
