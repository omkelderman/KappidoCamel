As such, much of the gameplay available to you in v2.2 is the result of a recent mobile-focused sprint and we intend to progress to a PC-focused sprint within the coming months. Please take this into consideration, as while adjustments will continue to be made to the PC platform to account for the game's differing payment model (buy-to-play on PC &amp; free-to-play on mobile), some areas of balance and design may retain certain elements of the mobile version for the time being.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/232810\/extras\/Godus_Main_Strap_616x353.png?t=1433944780\">\r<br>\r<br>Have you ever wanted to play god?
