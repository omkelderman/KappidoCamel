We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what\u2019s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it\u2019s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems. \r<br>\r<br>In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) \u2013 and it controls almost every piece of the city\u2019s technology and holds key information on all of the city\u2019s residents. \r<br>\r<br>You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy.  Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city\u2019s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy\u2026and more. \r<br>\r<br>Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES<\/h2>\r\r<br><strong>HACK THE CITY<\/strong>\r<br>Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city\u2019s infrastructure.  Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city\u2019s CTOS can become your weapon.\r<br>\r<br><strong>STREET JUSTICE<\/strong>\r<br>Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation.  The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons. \r<br>\r<br><strong>HIGH OCTANE DRIVING<\/strong>\r<br>Ubisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game bursting with horsepower.
