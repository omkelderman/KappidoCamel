A new launcher synchronizes any mods you have subscribed to,  and lets you customize their activation state and loading priority. In addition, when playing Internet games in the lobby, you will be able to filter modded games by mod combination, and with a single button click, subscribe to those mods. Torchlight 2 will then restart, synchronize them, and activate them before returning you to the game.\r<br>\r<br>When playing modded games, you can view your mod history, any previously played mods, and the impact disabling mods may have on your character.\r<br>\r<br>We've tried to make the process as seamless as possible, with a focus on allowing modded multiplayer games with a minimum of fuss.<\/p><br><h1>GUTS<\/h1><p>GUTS is our in-house development tool, now fully integrated with Steam Workshop. You can publish directly to Steam Workshop when you compile your mod, making it available immediately for others to play.\r<br>\r<br>We've also added a special tool to GUTS designed to convert pre-GUTS mods into the official mod format, with an eye toward making the transition much easier for our ambitious early modders.\r<br>\r<br>You can learn more about using GUTS <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/docs.runicgames.com\/wiki\/Main_Page\"  >here<\/a>.<\/p><br><h1>New Content<\/h1><p>This release also includes new game content!\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The NetherRealm tileset - new NetherRealm dungeons can be found via portals throughout the world\r<br><\/li><li>New Monsters\r<br><\/li><li>New armor sets\r<br><\/li><li>New weapons\r<br><\/li><li>New pets - including the Headcrab!\r<br><\/li><li>New endgame map content\r<br><\/li><li>Some additional new dungeons in New Game plus modes in large overworld areas\r<\/li><\/ul><\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>The award-winning action RPG is back, bigger and better than ever!
