Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can.

The new assets you earn every week will help immensely \u2014 as long as they're used wisely.\r<br>\r<br>Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly.
