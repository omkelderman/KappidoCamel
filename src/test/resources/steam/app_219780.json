It's been a long time since I've played an RPG that manages to balance a lengthy, in-depth story with such a self-aware and hilarious script\u201d<br>&ndash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.incgamers.com\/2010\/11\/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga-review\">IncGamers<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe writing is consistently terrific, from the genuinely creative quests with multiple solutions to the NPCs which are all hand-crafted and infused with personality. Where other games would have copy + pasted Unclickable Villager A and B a few dozen times, Divinity 2 gives you an actual village, complete with gossipers, philanderers, military deserters, the occasional secret murderer, and even a few normal people\u201d<br>9\/10 &ndash; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.somethingawful.com\/d\/video-game-article\/dragon-knight-saga.php\">SomethingAwful<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cIt's amazing such a good game remained undiscovered until this \"remastered\" version was released.
