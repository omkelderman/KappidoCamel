The changes took close to a year to make, but in the end I decided to give it away FREE, as a gesture of thanks to all the fans on PC and Mac who supported the original game.\r<br>\r<br>Thanks for playing, and I hope you enjoy the new version of the game!<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>An updated and remastered version of the smash-hit psychological survival adventure, made by one man and played by hundreds of thousands!\r<br>\r<br><i>The masked protagonist must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means necessary.  Starving and exhausted, he has begun to question how much of what he sees is even real.\r<br>                                                                                     \r<br>How to survive is up to YOU.  Sneak through without firing a single shot, or kill everything in your path.  Eat and sleep well, or resort to drugs to keep going.  Search for survivors, or try to escape the city alone.  Look after your mental health, or descend into madness...<\/i>\r<br>\r<br>Lone Survivor is unusual mix of survival horror, stealth mechanics, adventure games, a virtual pet, a physical and psychological survival simulation and a truly interactive story. The player is encouraged to role-play and forget about the game's workings, while the story moulds to match the player's actions. This is a game where your choices genuinely matter. \r<br>\r<br>The Director's Cut Edition of the game now includes a great deal of new content, new lighting engine and other graphical and audio enhancements, and the two new endings and three new side-quests also seen in the recent PlayStation releases.
