The result is Shadowgrounds Survivor, and it's every bit as good as the first release. Survivor, the extended remix of Shadowgrounds, is a must-have for any fans of action-horror.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>- Worthplaying - 89% (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.worthplaying.com\/article.php?sid=49020\"  >full review<\/a>)\r<br>\r<br>&quot;FrozenByte definitely has a winner on its hand. If you have the hankering to play an action top down shooter that looks good and has addictive gameplay, look no further than Shadowgrounds: Survivor.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>- GamingTrend - 89% (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.gamingtrend.com\/Reviews\/review\/review.php?ReviewID=971\"  >full review<\/a>)\r<br>\r<br>&quot;I don't know of any other top-down shooters for the PC which are done as well, or look as good or cost $20.  You also receive the tools to completely mod the game and create additional maps.  Generally my rule is that if I feel like replaying a game right after I finish it, that's a good enough indication of its worth, and Survivor is definitely worth it.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>- 2024 - 85% (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.2404.org\/reviews\/2745\/Shadowgrounds-Survivor-Review\"  >full review<\/a>)","header_image":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/11200\/header.jpg?t=1427188419","website":"http:\/\/www.shadowgroundssurvivor.com\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong>\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Supported OS:<\/strong> Windows\u00ae XP \/ Windows\u00ae Vista\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 1.5 GHz Processor (2.0 GHz+ recommended)\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 512 MB RAM (1024 MB RAM recommended)\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> DirectX compatible 128 MB graphics card (512 MB recommended)\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<\/li><li><strong>DirectX Version:<\/strong> DirectX\u00ae 9.0c\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<\/li><li><strong>Sound:<\/strong> DirectX compatible sound card\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive:<\/strong>1 GB Hard Drive space\r<br>\t\t\t\t\t<\/li><li>Gamepad required for co-op play<\/li><\/ul>\r\r<br>NOTE: Shadowgrounds: Survivor uses PhysX, which is a physics library by NVIDIA.
