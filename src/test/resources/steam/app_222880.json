Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.\r<br>\r<br><i>Skirmish<\/i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.\r<br>\r<br><i>Occupy<\/i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area.

The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.\r<br>\r<br><i>Strike<\/i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory.

The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.\r<br>\r<br><i>Infiltrate<\/i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.\r<br>\r<br><i>Flashpoint<\/i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.\r<br>\r<br><i>Elimination<\/i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperative Game Modes<\/h2>\r\r<br><i>Checkpoint<\/i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.\r<br>\r<br><i>Hunt<\/i> --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.\r<br>\r<br><i>Survival<\/i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.\r<br>\r<br><i>Outpost<\/i> --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it.
