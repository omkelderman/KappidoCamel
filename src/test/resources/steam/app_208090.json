A private match can range from 2 to 8 players, with or without bots, and allows for the party leader to choose gamemode and map. Also in the update is the new map, Comm Tower. This vertical map is effectively spaced to give you the best of full-throttle close-quarters action while still providing ample space for long-range action. Additionally, we added updates to the matchmaking algorithm, added new character parts for Helga and T-Bone, fixed multiple bugs and rebalanced each map and the associated gamemodes. You can find this information in the post below.\r<br>\r<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Major Updates<\/h2><\/strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Private Playlist<\/h2>\r\r<br>Players now have the ability to create their own private matches. The private match system is limited to 2 to 8 players at any given time, with an option to turn on or off the bots. Uneven teams are supported, with or without bots. Players will not earn rewards such as blutes or XP and will not progress through the game while playing in a private match. Party leader is able to choose the map and mode to their liking and AFK players will not timeout if away from the private match screen.\r<br>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2-8 players\r<br><\/li><li>Bot fillers can be turned on\/off\r<br><\/li><li>No AFK timeout\r<br><\/li><li>No end game screen\/ No progression, blutes, XP<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Level: Comm Tower<\/h2>\r\r<br>Comm Tower is available for Deathsnatch, Blitz, Domination, Extraction and Jackhammer gamemodes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Additional patch information<\/h2>\r<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Age Gate (17+ restriction for new players)\r<br><\/li><li>Refinements to the Casual Matchmaking algorithm<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Outfitter Items<\/h2>\r<strong>Helga<\/strong>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fattoos\r<br><\/li><li>Sci-Fi Pads (Orange)\r<br><\/li><li>Sci-Fi Shirt (Orange)<\/li><\/ul>\r<strong>T-Bone<\/strong>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Orgasm Donor Tee<\/li><\/ul>\r\r<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bug Fixes<\/h2><\/strong>\r<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fixed bugs causing UI screens to freeze.\r<br><\/li><li>Party chat log now clears when entering a lobby.\r<br><\/li><li>In-game chat will resume if temporarily interrupted.\r<br><\/li><li>Bots are no longer always on the radar.
